  <p>You really good at sleeping in class too.</p>
  <h2>Big idea</h2>
  <p>The idea about this lesson is storing your changes of your files whenever you improved your code or changed your code. So you can restore your code if your newer code bug out or get stolen.
    If I rate from 1 to 4, I would rate it at 3, because the note does help me to understand how to work with git, but I haven't know how is git working yet. The 3 states of git are
    first, the git directory, where the git file is saved at, it is a hidden folder but it could delete by deleteing the parent folder. Second is the working directory, which is outside the git folder, is where the files that will be change stored,
    last is the staging area where is will merge the working directory into the git directory.
